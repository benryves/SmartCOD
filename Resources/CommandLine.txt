Usage:

  SmartCOD -option value command

  Option names start with a -dash and all options must precede the
  corresponding command.

  Options are retained after executing a command, so for example if
  you are building and loading a .COD file in one command line you
  only need to specify -cod <filename> before the build command and
  it will still be set when the load command runs.

  If you need to unset an option you can do so manually with the
  -unset <option> option.

Commands:

  BUILD

      -cod <filename>        : Filename of the .COD file to generate.
