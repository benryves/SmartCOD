# SmartCOD

The 65C02-based Economatics SmartBox is a computer control interface that allows the user to load and execute custom code via its serial port.
This code is normally stored in a COD file (e.g. AL.COD from the SmartMove software).
As it is not known ahead of time where in memory your code is going to be loaded this COD file contains a code stub that calls the SmartBox OS's relocation routine along with a bitmap of relocation data.

To create the single COD file containing your job's code, the relocation routines and the relocation bitmap the SmartCOD tool needs:
1. The "master" machine code for your job assembled at reference origin &0100.
2. The "difference" machine code for your job assembled at some other origin (e.g. &0200).
3. The offset to the relocation routine's entry point in the assembled program. This should be stored in the first two bytes of the program (little-endian).

The [SmartBox OS documentation](https://github.com/Phipli/SmartBox/issues/2#issuecomment-597111920) goes into detail about how such jobs should be written, but here is the sample code in a form that can be assembled using [beebasm](https://github.com/stardot/beebasm/):

When assembled the above program will output two files, code1 and code2.
These can then be combined into a single DEMO.COD file which is then loaded to the SmartBox with the following SmartCOD command-lines:

```
SmartCOD -cod DEMO.COD build
SmartCOD -cod DEMO.COD -port COM1 load
SmartCOD -port COM1 list
```

The request to "list" will show all jobs (by number and name) currently available on the SmartBox so you can verify that DemoJob has been installed.

It's also possible to combine the three separate commands into a single command-line, without needing to repeat options:

```
SmartCOD -cod DEMO.COD build -port COM1 load list
```

Running the job that you have installed on the SmartBox is currently outside the scope of this tool as that will depend on what inputs your job accepts and what outputs it generates which cannot be determined ahead of time.
Running your installed job will generally follow this process:

1. Use the NameCode job on the SmartBox to get the call number of your job: send the byte 3, then the name of your job as an ASCII string terminated with CR (13), then read one byte back. That returned byte will have the call number.
2. Send the call number byte to the SmartBox, then any input data that your job requires (the job will retrieve the input data from the caller via OS_READJOB).
3. Read back as many bytes from the SmartBox as your job is designed to return (the job will send output data to the caller via OS_SENDJOB).

## Command-line usage

```
SmartCOD [-option value] command [arguments]
```

Option names start with a `-dash` and all options must precede the corresponding command.

Options are retained after executing a command, so for example if you are building and loading a .COD file in one command line you only need to specify `-cod <filename>` before the build command and it will still be set when the load command runs.

If you need to unset an option you can do so manually with the `-unset <option>` option.

Most commands do not take arguments however the `CALL` command will always take a job name and any arguments previously specified for that job name with the `-params` option.

### BUILD

Build a .COD file from a "master" and "difference" compiled file.

| Option                   | Description                                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-cod <filename>`        | Filename of the .COD file to generate.                          |
| `-master <filename>`     | Filename of the master code file (optional, defaults to code1). |
| `-difference <filename>` | Name of the difference code file (optional, defaults to code2). |

```
SmartCOD -cod DEMOJOB.COD build
```

### LOAD

Downloads a .COD file to the SmartBox and executes it.

| Option             | Description                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `-cod <filename>`  | Filename of the .COD file to load and execute. |
| `-port <portname>` | Name of the SmartBox's serial port.            |

```
SmartCOD -cod DEMOJOB.COD -port COM1 load
```

### CALL

Calls a job on the SmartBox.

| Option             | Description                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `-params <params>` | Parameters for the job.                        |
| `-port <portname>` | Name of the SmartBox's serial port.            |
      

| Argument      |                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| `<jobname>`   | Name of the job to call.              |
| `<arguments>` | As defined with the `-params` option. |

```
SmartCOD -port COM1 -params (?--$) call CodeName 20
SmartCOD -port COM1 -params (?,?,?--) call OutputPower 0 2 48
```

Parameters take the form `(<inputs>--<outputs>)` where the inputs and outputs are comma-separated lists of data types:

| Symbol              | Type                    |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| `?` or `&` or `B`   | Byte                    |
| `??` or `&&` or `W` | 16-bit word             |
| `!` or `%` or `I`   | 32-bit integer          |
| `$` or `S`          | String (CR-terminated)  |
| `$0` or `S0`        | String (NUL-terminated) |

For example, `(?--$)` defines a job call that takes a byte as input and returns a string as output or `(??,?--)` defines a job that takes a 16-bit word and byte as input and has no output.

The `-params` option is cleared automatically after invoking the call however if you re-call a job without supplying new parameters the parameter definition will be remembered from the previous call.

### LIST

Lists jobs on the connected SmartBox.

| Option             | Description                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `-port <portname>` | Name of the SmartBox's serial port.      |

```
SmartCOD -port COM1 list
```

### RESET

Resets the SmartBox.

| Option                     | Description                                                        |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-reset hard/soft/<value>` | Hard reset clears battery-backed RAM (optional, defaults to soft). |
| `-port <portname>`         | Name of the SmartBox's serial port.                                |

```
SmartCOD -port COM1 -reset hard reset
```
